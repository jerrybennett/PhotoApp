# DunderGram/PhotoApp

## Overview 
An instagram style clone originally featuring content from NBC’s The Office created with Ruby on Rails.

## Site Features
A user can sign up or log in to post, comment, and like photos just like Instagram. If a user is not logged in, they can still browse the website, profiles and images.

## Tech Used
• ERB (Embedded Ruby) templating for views/presentation
• Ruby on Rails API
• PaperClip gem to handle uploading of image files
• BCrypt to handle authenication

1. Fork or download
2. Open the "PhotoApp" file in terminal
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `rake db:migrate` to set up the database
